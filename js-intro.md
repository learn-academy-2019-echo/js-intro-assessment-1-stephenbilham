# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: Part1. A function is a key word that is used in javaScript to call something withing your scope to perform a task. You need to define your function and you need to set an argument if necessary. 
  Part 2. You would use a function to one, have effiencent code. The ability to have the functions syntax to repeat or perfom a task is overall useful as a dev. 

  Researched answer: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: arr.join(), arr.map(), arr.toUpperCase, arr.Math.max() ?, arr.splice

  Researched answer:

The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array values. ...
Popping. The pop() method removes the last element from an array: ...
Pushing. ...
Shifting Elements. 
Changing Elements. 
Splicing an Array. 
Merging (Concatenating) Arrays. 
Slicing an Array.



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log() will show what is logged on the terminal while return on the otherhand won't. 

  Researched answer: When using the return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value. console.log prints the string in firebug console. 
... return just return from the function without processing further code or you can say, A function immediately stops at the point where return is called.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: the argument is the passing value given to the function, where as a variable is created by a keyword that can hold data and values that can be used.   

  Researched answer: part1. Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.
  part2. A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. 
  Parameter is variable in the declaration of function. Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: The roles we have reviewed are the following: driver and operator. Driving you are hands on with the code while also brainstorming and explaining what you are doing. On the otherhand, the navigator is responsible for futher thinking of the direction of the code and looking for syntax errors & so on. **make sure you switch positions! 

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. 
  One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: javaScript is a computer language that allows userbased functionality with algorithms that perform tasks. In all, javaScript is a language that performs functionality. 


7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The paired partnering really helps. When you are lost, you have someone to brainstorm ideas with and you don't get lost in thought. We have gone over so many concepts over the week that it becomes easy to lose sight of your objective and it's great going through it with someone else.
